          Across the road from where I grew up, there was a barren field, the city never did anything with it, parks and rec believed it unrescuable. Yet without a proper sign designating this a place for families to picnic, barbecue, etc, everyone used it as a gathering place for the sort of stuff the sterile city could not offer. This dusty patch was everything, especially to the neighborhood kids who did not have much to do after school, and so would congregate, play with rc cars, bike through rough dirt, run. This is what I did, and what I remember most fondly of my hometown. This dusty patch created memories, of laying in fields of wild grass with a whole afternoon to waste, building kites out of paper and sticks to fly with surprising success, of inventing games to play in that winding wild place, one which involved throwing a crowbar into the field, whoever found it first would get to throw it next. It would arc out and slowly dip below the horizon of tall grasses and fennel.

          The dusty patch sat in front of a levee, behind which laid the salt marshes and wetlands that opened up onto the bay, the remnants of the city's construction on landfill. This area is covered in a thick forest of wild fennel, plants most taller than people, and the dirt is a mix of crushed seashells and decaying weeds, a wonderland ripped straight out of a Jules Verne adventure. Laying deep within that thick forest lay the words, poured in concrete, the name of the city in which it lies in. Now cracking from decades of negligence and paint fading from the beating of a Californian sun, this monument to the city withers away in obscurity, most who walk over it do not realize what is said beneath their feet. This dusty patch and the fennel forest it conceals is the rare stretch of unadulterated land, its creation itself a construction, but transformed from years of inaction into a wild which many explore.

          Because I lived so close to the area, this would often be a retreat for me during those long summer days where I was the last to leave for college. It is a swirl of anxiety, boredom and nostalgia, the feeling I have prior to leaving for something new in my life, and in those moments of restlessness the escape would be across the road and into the forest to take a quick walk. From the breaking of the paved asphalt path on top of the levee and into the crushed seashell dirt trails that wind through the marshes and fennel, the immersion was absolute and instant. The dirt path would take you below the street right onto sea level, below the entirety of the city behind the levee which stands guard against any unforeseen storm surge, or perhaps to guard against the purported loch ness monster like creature that lives in the San Francisco Bay. The short trails cut in and out, with random turns which eventually opened up, after many double backs and roundabouts, onto the Bay. Occasionally when it is high tide, the meeting of the fennel and the water looks as if it were a white sand beach, like those on the Pacific islands far away from this lookout onto the opposite shores across the water. The path always leads back to the levee, and the levee back to my hometown.

          The city ultimately decided to convert that dusty patch with no name into a sanctioned park. They planned it out, to no protest, paved it over, attempted to plant grass, used tanbark due to the drought, and built a travesty. Joggers now take the place of the intrepid teenage tinkerer who built a potato canon or hobby rocket. There is no reason that park should have been built other than to increase the value of the neighborhood properties, but with its poorly planned construction, the neighborhood is even less an attractive place to live after one sees the blight of municipal hubris which stains an otherwise scenic view onto the bay.

          The fennel forest remains for now, and is still a get away for many neighborhood inhabitants. When I visit my hometown, I often still come out to the levee.
